1. Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
    Result of backtrace:
    Thread 1 hit Breakpoint 1, syscall () at kernel/syscall.c:158
    (gdb) backtrace
    #0 syscall () at kernel/syscall.c:158
    #1 0x0000000080001ab8 in usertrap () at kernel/trap.c:67
    #2 0x0505050505050505 in ?? ()
    --> The function called syscall is usertrap()

2. What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent?
    The value of p->trapframe->a7 is 0x7.
    Look at initcode.S, SYS_exec --> a7, so 0x7 là syscall number of SYS_exec
        #include "syscall.h"

        # exec(init, argv)
        .globl start
        start:
                la a0, init
                la a1, argv
                li a7, SYS_exec //Here
                ecall
        ...

3. What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
    $sstatus value is: 0x20000000000022 (hex) --> 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010(binary)
    Infomation about previous mode is 8th bit (count from 0): 0
    0 is Usermode, 1 is kernelmode
    --> the previous mode is usermode.
